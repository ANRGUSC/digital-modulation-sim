Wireless Modulation Simulator - Review Questions
================================================

These questions are designed to reinforce concepts from the simulator.
Answer them after experimenting with different modulation schemes and SNR values.


QUESTIONS
---------

Q1. (T/F) QPSK achieves twice the data rate of BPSK while having the same
    Bit Error Rate (BER) performance at a given Eb/N0.

    Verify: Compare BER curves for BPSK and QPSK at the same SNR


Q2. (MCQ) How many bits are transmitted per symbol in 64-QAM?
    A) 4 bits
    B) 6 bits
    C) 8 bits
    D) 64 bits

    Verify: Check the statistics panel when 64-QAM is selected


Q3. (T/F) At the same Eb/N0, 16-QAM has a lower BER than QPSK.

    Verify: Compare the BER curves or theoretical BER values at 10 dB


Q4. (MCQ) What happens to the received constellation diagram as you decrease the SNR?
    A) Points cluster more tightly around ideal positions
    B) Points scatter more widely around ideal positions
    C) The number of constellation points decreases
    D) The constellation rotates

    Verify: Adjust SNR slider from 15 dB down to 5 dB and observe


Q5. (T/F) The bandwidth of a digitally modulated signal depends primarily on the
    symbol rate (1/T), not on whether you use QPSK or 64-QAM.

    Verify: Switch between modulation schemes and observe the frequency spectrum


Q6. (MCQ) In 8-PSK, all constellation points lie on a circle because:
    A) All symbols have the same amplitude but different phases
    B) All symbols have the same phase but different amplitudes
    C) It uses only the I channel
    D) It requires less bandwidth than QAM

    Verify: Observe the 8-PSK constellation diagram and passband waveforms


Q7. (T/F) To achieve a BER of 10^-5, 64-QAM requires approximately 6 dB higher
    Eb/N0 than QPSK.

    Verify: Find where each BER curve crosses 10^-5 on the BER plot


Q8. (MCQ) Gray coding is used in constellation mapping because:
    A) It maximizes the data rate
    B) Adjacent symbols differ by only one bit, minimizing bit errors when symbol errors occur
    C) It reduces the required bandwidth
    D) It eliminates the need for the Q channel

    Verify: Examine bit labels on adjacent constellation points (e.g., in QPSK: 00, 01, 11, 10)


Q9. (T/F) Raised cosine pulse shaping reduces the signal bandwidth compared to
    rectangular pulses, which helps minimize interference with adjacent channels.

    Verify: Toggle between Rectangular and Raised Cosine and compare the frequency spectrum width


Q10. (MCQ) If you've transmitted 50,000 bits and observed 50 bit errors, what is
     the simulated BER?
     A) 10^-2
     B) 10^-3
     C) 10^-4
     D) 10^-5

     Verify: Run simulation until ~50,000 bits and check the statistics panel calculation

ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q1.  TRUE
     Explanation: QPSK uses orthogonal I/Q channels, each performing like BPSK.
     This doubles the data rate (2 bits/symbol vs 1 bit/symbol) without
     sacrificing BER performance.

Q2.  B) 6 bits
     Explanation: 64-QAM has 64 constellation points, and 2^6 = 64, so 6 bits
     are needed to represent each symbol.

Q3.  FALSE
     Explanation: Higher-order modulation (like 16-QAM) has WORSE BER at the
     same SNR because constellation points are closer together, making them
     more susceptible to noise.

Q4.  B) Points scatter more widely around ideal positions
     Explanation: Lower SNR means more noise power relative to signal power,
     causing received symbols to deviate further from their ideal positions.

Q5.  TRUE
     Explanation: Bandwidth is determined by the symbol rate (1/T) and pulse
     shaping, not the modulation order. Higher-order modulation achieves better
     spectral efficiency (bits/Hz) by packing more bits per symbol into the
     same bandwidth.

Q6.  A) All symbols have the same amplitude but different phases
     Explanation: PSK (Phase Shift Keying) encodes information purely in the
     phase of the carrier. All 8-PSK symbols have unit amplitude but are
     separated by 45 degrees (360/8) in phase.

Q7.  TRUE
     Explanation: 64-QAM requires approximately 6 dB more Eb/N0 than QPSK to
     achieve the same BER. This is the trade-off for higher spectral efficiency
     (6 bits/symbol vs 2 bits/symbol).

Q8.  B) Adjacent symbols differ by only one bit, minimizing bit errors when
        symbol errors occur
     Explanation: With Gray coding, when noise causes a symbol to be decoded as
     an adjacent symbol (the most common error), only 1 bit is wrong instead of
     potentially multiple bits.

Q9.  TRUE
     Explanation: Rectangular pulses have a sinc spectrum with theoretically
     infinite bandwidth. Raised cosine shaping concentrates energy into a
     finite bandwidth of (1+alpha)/T, reducing out-of-band emissions and
     adjacent channel interference.

Q10. B) 10^-3
     Explanation: BER = (bit errors) / (total bits) = 50 / 50,000 = 0.001 = 10^-3
